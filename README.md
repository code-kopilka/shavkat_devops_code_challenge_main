# LogicGate DevOpe Code Challenge

## Overview

Welcome to the LogicGate 🐐 DevOps Code Challenge! This repo is an example project that you might encounter in your day-to-day as a DevOps Engineer at LogicGate. 

## TODO

Your task, should you choose to accept it, is to review this download of the `main` branch and apply any findings and/or recommendations you have for this repo before it gets deployed to the cloud ☁️.

## Rules

1. Don't apply the `infra` Terraform / OpenTofu `.tf` files. This will incur charges which we LogicGate are not responsible for.

2. Feel free to use any resources / tools in your review.

3. Your final deliverable should be a zip file representing a pull request with your code changes and any commentary or questions for the review/interview panels.
